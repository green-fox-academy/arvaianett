        <p>Ceratophrys is a genus of frogs in the family Ceratophryidae.
        </p>
        <p>They are also known as South American horned frogs as well as Pacman frogs due to their characteristically round shape and large mouth, thus reminiscent of the video game character Pac-Man.
        </p>
        <p>The female frog will not "chirp" or "croak" as often as males, but do sometimes. Males frequently have spotted chests, and at about a year old the males develop spots on their "pads" or "fingers."
        </p>
        <p>Males will also sometimes have subtle pads on their front legs during mating season.
        </p>
        <p>In captivity, C. cranwelli, C. ornata and C. cornuta are the most popular species. These frogs can live in a 10-gallon aquarium for their entire lives.
        </p>
        <p>They thrive best with a shallow bowl of water, loose moist substrate (like coco coir), and hiding places.
        </p>
        <p>They will commonly cover themselves with substrate or just sit contentedly in the water.
